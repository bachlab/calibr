\value{
A list with three elements:
\describe{
\item{meta_results}{Data frame with one row per measurement containing:
\code{measurement}, \code{log_combined_bayes_factor},
\code{retrodiction_score}, \code{sample_size}, and \code{combined_t_statistic}.}
\item{subject_overlap}{Matrix of shared subjects between measurements, if applicable.}
\item{weights}{List of per-dataset weight tables for each measurement.}
}
}
\description{
Computes \strong{meta-analytic Bayes Factors (BFs)} and a \strong{meta-analytic retrodiction score}
(a correlation measure) for each measurement across datasets.
}
\details{
For each measurement:
\itemize{
\item Extracts per-dataset t-statistics and ancillary stats via \code{extract_stats()}.
\item Combines t-statistics using \code{compute_weights()} to form a weighted t (\code{sum(weights * t_i)}).
\item Computes the Bayes factor from that combined t using \code{tstat2bf()}.
\item Computes the \strong{meta-analytic retrodiction score} by converting each t to its
corresponding correlation (\eqn{r_i = t_i / \sqrt{t_i^2 + \mathrm{df}_i}}),
Fisher-z transforming each, weighting by their residual degrees of freedom
(\eqn{w_i = \mathrm{df}_i - 1}), averaging, and back-transforming with \eqn{tanh()}.

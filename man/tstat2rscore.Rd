\title{Convert t-Statistic to Pearson Correlation (r-Score)}
\usage{
tstat2rscore(t_statistic, sample_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{t_statistic}{A numeric value representing the t-statistic.}

\item{sample_size}{An integer representing the total sample size.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the Pearson correlation coefficient (r-score).
}
\description{
This function converts a t-statistic into a Pearson correlation coefficient (r-score),
given the sample size. The conversion is based on the relationship between the t-statistic
and the correlation coefficient in linear regression.
}
\details{
The conversion formula used is:
\deqn{ r = \frac{t}{\sqrt{(N - 2) + t^2}} }
where:
\itemize{
\item  r  is the Pearson correlation coefficient.
\item  t  is the t-statistic.
\item  N  is the total sample size.
}

This formula follows from the equivalence of t-statistics and correlation coefficients
in simple linear regression.
}
\note{
The function requires that \code{sample_size > 2}, since degrees of freedom must be positive.

\examples{
# Example usage:
tstat2rscore(t_statistic = 2.5, sample_size = 30)

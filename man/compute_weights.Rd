\title{Compute Weights for Meta-Analysis}
\usage{
compute_weights(
  t_statistics,
  sample_sizes,
  sum_squares = rep(NA, length(sample_sizes))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t_statistics}{A numeric vector of t-statistics for each dataset.}

\item{sample_sizes}{A numeric vector of sample sizes corresponding to each dataset.}

\item{sum_squares}{A numeric vector of sum of squares for each dataset.
Defaults to \code{NA}, in which case weights are approximated
assuming equal variance.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of computed weights, normalized such that their sum of squares equals 1.
}
\description{
This function computes weights for combining test statistics in a meta-analytic
framework. The weights are based on sample sizes, degrees of freedom, and
optionally provided sum of squares. If sum of squares are not provided,
the function estimates weights assuming equal variance.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Compute weights with sum_squares provided
t_statistics <- c(2.5, 1.8, 2.0)
sample_sizes <- c(30, 40, 35)
sum_squares <- c(5, 6, 5.5)
compute_weights(t_statistics, sample_sizes, sum_squares)

# Example 2: Compute weights without sum_squares (approximate method)
compute_weights(t_statistics, sample_sizes)
}

Description: CalibR provides a suite of tools for experimental calibration in statistical analysis. 
    It includes functions for computing statistics based on sample sizes, degrees of freedom, 
    in complete and partial information cases. It also offers methods to combine calibration scores 
    (in the form of Bayes Factors against a ground measure), facilitating robust and principled statistical inference. 
    The package is based on the methodology presented in "Meta-Analysis of Bayes Factors" 
    by Stavros Nikolakopoulos and Ioannis Ntzoufras.
